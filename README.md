# SRP

     1.Each class should encapsulate a single functionality or aspect of the application, 
		 such as data management, business logic, or user interface interactions.

     2. Avoid "kitchen sink" classes that try to do too much and violate the SRP by having multiple responsibilities.

     3. When a class adheres to SRP, it's more testable, as each responsibility can be tested in isolation.

     4. SRP helps in collaboration among team members by providing clear roles and responsibilities for each class.
